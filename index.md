## Hello, World!

Hi, I'm **Giulio Isacchini**, and I am currently a senior machine learning research scientist at [Imprint Labs](https://www.imprint.org/), a [focused research organization](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros) that is working to decode disease information from immune receptor repertoires. Prior to joining Imprint, I was a Postdoctoral Scientist at UC Berkeley and a Humboldt Research Fellow at UniLeipzig characterizing where I studied how bacterial and viral evolution drives immune evasion.

I obtained my PhD jointly from ENS Paris and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, GÃ¶ttingen, where my research centered on generative modeling of immune receptor repertoires.
