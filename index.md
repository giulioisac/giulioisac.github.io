I am a Postdoc at UC Berkeley in theoretical biophysics.
I am interested in characterising how our adaptive immune system recognises pathogens and how the evolution of bacteria and viruses leads to immune evasion.
I develop unsupervised learning methods to model immune receptor repertoires and to describe evolutionary trajectories of evolving pathogens.
