## Hello, World!

Hi, I'm **Giulio Isacchini**, I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and University of Leipzig in theoretical biophysics.

I am interested in characterising how our adaptive immune system recognises pathogens and how the evolution of bacteria and viruses leads to immune evasion.
I develop unsupervised learning methods to model immune receptor repertoires and to describe evolutionary trajectories of evolving pathogens.
