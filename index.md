## Hello, World!

Hi, I'm **Giulio Isacchini**, and I am currently a senior machine learning research scientist at IMPRINT. Before, I was a Humboldt Research Fellow at UniLeipzig, a Postdoctoral Scientist at UC Berkeley, and a PhD student jointly between ENS Paris and MPI for Dynamics and Self-Organisaiton, Goettingen. 

I am interested in characterizing how our adaptive immune system recognizes pathogens and how the evolution of bacteria and viruses leads to immune evasion.
I develop unsupervised learning methods to model immune receptor repertoires and to describe the evolutionary trajectories of evolving pathogens.
