## Education
* 2022-Now: **Postdoc in Biophysics**, at University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Oskar Hallatschek. The research topic is to model evolutionary trajectories of pathogens and characterize to which extent recombination events can be detected in sequenced genomes.

* 2018–2021: **PhD in Machine learning of immune repertoire interactions**, jointly between Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Goettingen, and École Normale Superiéure, Paris. The objective of this PhD project is to use statistical learning methods combined with machine learning approaches to develop predictive models of immune repertoire response. Supervisors: Armita Nourmohammad, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra Walczak

* 2016–2018: **Master in High Energy Physics**, Jointly between ETH Zurich and École Polytechnique Paris. 
  * Internship at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, March-July 2018: The project aimed to contruct new models for the spiking activity of Ganglion cells in the retina through various ML techniques.
  * Internship at CERN: I used Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with Quantile Error function in order to fit generic multivariate distributions of random variable. I applied the technique to calibrate MC simulations of the interaction of Photons with the CMS Detector at CERN.

* 2015–2016: **One-year Erasmus**, UiO, Oslo, Norway.
  * Internship at CERN: Collaboration with the ATLAS@Home project at CERN for a semester in order to develop a graphical user interface for the project.

* 2013–2016: **Bachelor in Physics**, Università di Trento, Italy. Result: 110/110 e Lode (with honors)
  * Honor program in physics of the bachelor degree.
  * Elected as a student representative in the Council of the Department of Physics.

* 2008–2013: **Highschool Diploma**, Liceo Scientifico G. Fracastoro, Verona, Italy.
  * Elected as a Student representative in "Consulta Provinciale degli studenti".
  * Exchange semester in Phitsanulok Pittayakom School,Thailand.
