## Education
* 2022-Now: **Postdoc in Biophysics**, at University of California, Berkeley, and Univeristy of Leipzig. The objective of my research is to characterize how the evolution of bacteria and viruses leads to immune evasion. I develop unsupervised learning methods to describe the evolutionary trajectories of evolving pathogens and predict the spread of these pathogens in a structured population.
  * Head of laboratory: Oskar Hallatsheck

* 2018–2021: **PhD in Machine learning of immune repertoire interactions**, jointly between Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Goettingen, and École Normale Superiéure, Paris. T and B cells rely on the diversity of their receptor sequences for antigen recognition. Biophysical models for the recombination of receptor chains have shown to well capture the statistics of the repertoire before selection. However, this diversity is subsequently reduced by thymic selection, which is not yet well characterized. In my PhD research project I applied a maximum likelihood approach to density ratio estimation to infer selection factors using deep neural network models and found that these non linear selection models accurately describe the distribution of immune receptors. I studied the differentiation pathways of T cells during thymic development and showed that T cell subtypes have significantly different repertoires both at the global and local level.
  * Supervisors: Armita Nourmohammad, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra Walczak

* 2016–2018: **Master in High Energy Physics**, Jointly between ETH Zurich and École Polytechnique Paris. 
  * Internship at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, March-July 2018: Modeling the spiking activity of Ganglion cells in the retina with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
  * Internship at CERN: Inference of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with Quantile Error function to multivariate distributions of photon shower shape variables. I applied the technique to calibrate MC simulations of the interaction of Photons with the CMS
Detector at CERN.
 
* 2013–2016: **Bachelor in Physics**, Università di Trento, Italy. Result: 110/110 e Lode (with honors)
  * Honor program in physics of the bachelor degree.
  * Elected as a student representative in the Council of the Department of Physics.
  * One-year Erasmus, UiO, Oslo, Norway.
  * Internship at CERN: Collaboration with the ATLAS@Home project at CERN for a semester in order to develop a graphical user interface for the project.

* 2008–2013: **Highschool Diploma**, Liceo Scientifico G. Fracastoro, Verona, Italy.
  * Elected as a Student representative in "Consulta Provinciale degli studenti".
  * Exchange semester in Phitsanulok Pittayakom School,Thailand.
